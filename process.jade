The most essential elements of the proposed solutions can be tested and validated using feedback from real users. Building prototypes allows the team to quickly validate assumptions before expending considerable time and budget.

To be successful, user testing requires a well thought-out process and a focus on gathering quantifiable data from the qualitative experience. User testing is essential to the success of every digital product. 
                p Usability testing can result in a 90% reduction in support costs after project completion.
                p Up to 85% of usability issues can be found in testing of 3-5 participants, making the end user’s experience much better after preliminary user testing

                p A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first iteration of a product that fulfills the product purpose and objectives defined and validated during the preflight. MVP product development creates user validated digital products, often in shorter timelines and at lower costs. When the core product is valuable, users will actually help guide the additional feature priorities during future growth and further iterations.

                h5.caps Design
                p At RevUnit, the heart of the design process, like everything we do, is focused on the end User Experience (UX). UX is the number one guiding force in all design.
                p Studies show 70% of projects fail due to lack of user acceptance. Source?
                p UX Design increases the success of Key Performance Indicators by 83%
                p In the creative process of any digital product, UX Designers use the designs and feedback generated during Rapid Prototyping and User Testing phases to create the rest of the experience. Designers focus on making the app intuitive and incorporating all functionality requirements while keeping the product visually attractive. 
                p Our design process uses tools to make collaboration easier between Designers and Developers when building the code. Each of our UX Designers is also talented in creating the User Interface--the actual graphics, buttons, colors, and icons users will see in the app. The creative process brings all of the problem solving to life in a real, visual way.

                h5.caps Development
                p While the creative team is in the early stages of designing, the development team goes to work. Developers use the user stories written in the early stages of Pre-flight to understand the level of complexity and purpose of each micro-experience. They use these stories to create the code needed to build the app. 
                p The development team works in short periods of time, known as sprints, which are essential to using the agile method. Sprints are defined as a set period of time, commonly two weeks. When planning a development process, development times are created based on the understanding of how many user stories the team can code in each sprint. 
                p Working with sprints allows for exceptional agility. If a new design is created or a current user story is reprioritized, sprints make it easy to predict how that adjustment will affect the overall product timeline. With user stories and sprints, the development process becomes fluid and transparent for the entire team as they build the MVP and prepare for launch.

                h5.caps PRODUCT ADOPTION
                p At RevUnit, we do not believe in the old adage, If you build it, they will come.  We do not believe in finishing a product and deploying it without a plan for success. This is why we fold Product Adoption into the process of every digital product we develop.
                p Product Adoption is the process of successfully onboarding new users and retaining   existing ones by engaging users throughout the product lifecycle.
                p Product Adoption does not only focus on the growth of a product or the retention of users, but instead it merges these two practices into one. We do this by employing Product Adoption Strategists from Day One of the build.
                p On the day of launch, marketing and communication plans are in place to grow the new product’s user base. Analytics are already installed to provide real-time data about the app’s success and real-time feedback to the product team. 
                p After launch, the Product Adoption Strategist continues to help market and grow the digital product by executing the adoption and retention plans and, based on user feedback, suggesting features or functionality to add.

                h5.caps ITERATION
                p As the digital product moves into the hands of users, built-in feedback and analytics tools measure the success of each product feature included in the MVP. Rather than using a predetermined road map, our team is prepared to continually improve the product with updates based on data gathered from actual users. 
                p Digital products built as MVP’s are intended to be iterated and improved upon. By design, they require product teams to be responsive to user feedback and then create new user stories to add to and improve the product. Through learning fast and iterating often, the well-researched MVP can quickly become a robust, yet focused digital product success.
                p On the day of launch, marketing and communication plans are in place to grow the new product’s user base. Analytics are already installed to provide real-time data about the app’s success and real-time feedback to the product team.
